A Shop Management system using C++ 

This is a simple c++ based shop management program that 
I created for a semester project 
It uses many basic concept related to programming like conditionals
loops and file handling

It mainly uses file handling to create and store records of things like
user credentials , inventory , threat alerts in text files

additionaly it uses a simple encryption and decryption methods to read and write user credentials

It is a simple project that mainly is there to get me familiar with basic programming concepts
